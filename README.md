App.tsx File:
I added 11 additional screen to my project and linked them in the App.tsx file to allow navigation between screens. 

FilterSearchScreen.tsx Files:
I added a filter icon along side the Menu text that directs users to the Filter Search Screen which displays 4 course icons for useres to select (Starters, Main Course, Desert, Drinks).
By clicking a course icon, users will be able to view all the menu items for that selected course. eg: Starters (Garlic Bread, Onion Rings, Chicken Spring Rolls, Beef Skewers).

AddDishScreen.tsx Files
I used the same plus icon from my part 2 which now directed the chef to the Add Dish Screen which displays the 4 course icons for the chef to select to add new menu items to the application (Starters, Main Course, Desert, Drinks).
After the chef selects a course to add the new menu items in, the chef is required to add the dishes name, price, description and image link in order to add the new menu items to the application.
Once the chef has added the new dish, the dish is displayed in 2 screens. The Menu screen and the selected course screen eg: Starters.

DeleteScreen.tsx Files:
I added a bin icon  below the View Order button in the Menu Screen which taks the chef to the Delete Screen allowing the chef to delete menu items from the application.

Average Price Funtionality:
I added this functionality which calculates the Average price of all the menu items in the application.

Order Button:
I added the order button below the description of each menu item, allowing users to select and add the menu items of their choice to the View Order Screen.
